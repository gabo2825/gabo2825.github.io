(retelling an anecdote) ..me and my brother asleep, 
and I see: 
`9:30` in the morning
(swears)
Why have my parents not woken me up to go to school??
(swears) I've missed too many days :SadCat: 
and I go to my brother and I wake him up
MARTÍN!
**MARTÍÍÍN!!**
and he says _WHAT IS HAPPENING?_
IT'S 9:30 
and he goes _BUT WHY DID THEY NOT WAKE US UP TO GO TO SCHOOL_
I DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP
_put on the uniform!!_
and we put the clothes on
we put the pants on
(simulates brushing teeth)
_we have to tell dad_
and I go "***DAAAAAAAAD!!***"
IT'S 9:30!
and he goes _**why the heck are you here??      you had to go to schooool!**_
and we were _nooo! yees!_
and he says _I'm gonna take you there to make you get in! faster!_
and my mom comes in _where are you going??_
- we're going to school :SadCat: 
and she goes _IT'S SUNDAY_
[sorry to everyone who knows Spanish swear words]
