(retelling an anecdote) ..me and my brother asleep, 
and I see: 
`9:30` in the morning
[swear count: 1]
Why have my parents not woken me up to go to school??
[sc: 2] I've been late for too many days :SadCat: 
and I go to my brother and I wake him up
MARTÍN!
**MARTÍÍÍN!!**
and tells me '_WHAT IS HAPPENING?_'
IT'S 9:30 
and he goes '_BUT WHY DID THEY NOT WAKE US UP TO GO TO SCHOOL_'
I DON'T KNOW [sc: 3]
THEY'RE STILL ASLEEP [sc: 4]
'_put on the uniform!!_'
and we [sc: 5] put the clothes on
we put the pants on
(simulates brushing teeth)
[sc: 6] '_we have to tell dad_'
and I go "***DAAAAAAAAD!!***"
IT'S 9:30!
and he goes '_**why the heck [sc: 7] are you here??   you had to go to schooool!**_'
and everyone '_nooo!_' '_yees!_'
and he says '_I'm gonna take you there to make you get in! faster! [sc: 8]_'
and my mom comes in '_where are you going??_'
"we're going to school" :SadCat: 
and she goes '_IT'S SUNDAY_'
[sorry to everyone who knows Spanish swear words]
