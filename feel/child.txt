· Before addressing the Issue...

  I cannot think of a way to tell this to anybody without making them feel awkward around me.
  However, I have been thinking about this a lot, lately and a way I could say it, since it has been a long time.

  I have wondered "What would people feel like if I express my feelings to them?"


· The Issue

  I simply cannot stand being treated as a child,

  FINE, I am a growing child but I'm almost 17, and even if that is still being a _child_ I don't like being treated as one as it makes me feel small, uncomfortable and immature. Am I immature?


· How I feel about it

  It- feels bad... ..sometimes I think of just abandoning my social live one day and feel free for once...

  Stop referring to me as "the child", am I that immature?


· But,

  I do not mean to restrict anyone from expressing themselves, I just want to be included as one more.


· What else...

  It has been hard to engage a conversation with anybody, I can't get anybody to laugh and I find my messages out of place shortly after I post them.

  I have been there for the people who have been feeling down, but are people there for me when I am feeling down?


· Maybe it's me...

  Am I in the wrong for finding an inappropriate community to settle in?

  Does bottling up my feelings really make a difference on what people think of me?

  I don't think I should be hanging out with adults if that may not make me feel comfortable with myself.
